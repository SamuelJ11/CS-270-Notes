CHAPTER 1

I. A TOUR OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS

  A. Information is Bits + Context

    • characters are represented in 8-bit chunchs called bytes, according to the ACSI II standard.

    • the hello.c program is stored in a file as a sequence of bytes, which have an integer value that corresponds
      to some character --> files containing exclusively ACSI II characters are called text files

    • all statements are terminated by the invisible newline character '\n'

  B. Programs are Translated by other Programs into Different Forms

    • in order to run the hello.c program, the statements must be translated by other programs into low-level machine level 
      instructions, which are then packaged into an executable object program and stored as a binary disk file --> this 
      is performed by a compiler driver:

    • the gcc compiler reads the source file hello.c and translates it into 
      an executalbe object file (done in four phases):

        - Preprocessing phase:  the preprocessor (cpp) modifies the original C program accoriding to directives that begin
          with the '#' character, i.e. #include <stdio.h> command tells the preprocessor to read the contents of the system 
          header file with stdio.h and insert it directly inot the program text.  

            --> this results in another C program with the .i suffix
        
        - Compilation phase:  the compiler (cc1) translates the text file hello.i into a the text file hello.s, which contains 
          an assembly-language program.  

        - Assembly phase:  the assembler translates hello.s into machine-language instructions, packages them in a form known
          as a relocatable object program, and stores the result in a object file hello.object

        - Linking phase:  the printf function is part of the standard C library, which resides in a seperate
          precompiled object file called printf.o, which must be merged with our hello.o program.

          --> the linker handles this merging, which results in the hello file (executable)
